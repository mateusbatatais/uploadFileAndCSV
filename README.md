# Atix Challenge project

This project was created to show how to register images in local storage and display them in another route.
We have an example of working with CSV inclusion in local storage as well and listing the items evenly in another route.

Attention: Local storage has a size limit, so if your csv file is too big, it won't work. It would be ideal to include in a database.
